# Standardized Specialized Lending Scorecard for Project Finance

## Factor Hierarchy

### Top Level

Characteristics are grouped in a hierarchical tree structure with five top level **Risk Factor Groups**:

* Financial Strength
* Political and Legal Environment
* Transaction Characteristics
* Strength of Sponsor
* Security Package

### Lower Levels

Risk Factor Groups resolve in a number of **Risk Factors**

For example the Financial Strenght Risk Factor Group assesses the following:

* Market Conditions
* Financial Ratios
* Stress Analysis 
* Financial Structure


## Score Calculation

### Partial Scores
Each Risk Factor or Risk Sub-Factor Characteristic (as appropriate) is mapped into one of four possible Attributes as per the below schedule

* Category 1:	Strong
* Category 2:	Good
* Category 3:	Satisfactory
* Category 4:	Weak

The Partial Score of each attribute is the Category cardinality (i.e., 1, 2, 3, 4)

### Characteristic Weights

Characteristics at all levels of the hierarchy are assigned weights of relative importance. These weight assignments constitute a model component that must be specified and justified (documented) separately. 

Relative weights must be between 5% and 60%.


### Overall Score

The overall score is the weighted sum of partial scores. The overall score is rounded to the nearest cardinal number
